HD: add a switch between BLUE TERMINALS Z1 and +12V
SW: replace string "0011223344" with your phone number
Switching switch On/Off you'll receive a SMS.
Use code as template to create you own alarm system.

Some remarcs:

V2 used to store input's old state
V1=V2^I will show all new-changed inputs so:
 - ?V1&1=1 will fire if Z1 changed. Current I&1 will be 'TRUE' if Z1 just oppened. You may try ?I1  too.
 - ?V1&2 will check Z2
 - ?V1&4 - Z3
 - ?V1&8 - Z4, etc.
